# Python API

ViZDoom provides Python bindings for the library. The Python API is one-to-one with the C++ API. The only difference is the use of `snake_case` instead of `camelCase` for method and argument names.

There are many examples of how to use Python API in [examples/python](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/tree/master/examples/python) directory.
