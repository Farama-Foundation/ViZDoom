# C++ API

ViZDoom is implemented in C++ and can be used as a C++ library. The C++ API is one-to-one with the Python API. The only difference is the use of `camelCase` instead of `snake_case` for method names.

ViZDoom can be built as a static or dynamic library. The header files are located in the `include` directory.
See [examples/cpp](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/tree/master/examples/cpp) for examples, including CMake files for building.
