# DoomGame

DoomGame is the main object of the ViZDoom library, representing a single instance of the Doom game and providing the interface for a single agent/player to interact with the game. The object allows sending actions to the game, getting the game state, etc. The declarations of this class and its methods can be found in the `include/ViZDoomGame.h` header file.

Here we document all the methods of the DoomGame class and their corresponding Python bindings implemented as pybind11 module.


## Flow control methods

### `init`

| C++    | `bool init()`    |
| :--    | :--              |
| Python | `init() -> bool` |

Initializes ViZDoom game instance and starts a new episode.
After calling this method, the first state from a new episode will be available.
Some configuration options cannot be changed after calling this method.
Init returns true when the game was started properly and false otherwise.


---
### `close`

| C++    | `void close()`    |
| :--    | :--               |
| Python | `close() -> None` |

Closes ViZDoom game instance.
It is automatically invoked by the destructor.
The game can be initialized again after being closed.


---
### `newEpisode`

| C++    | `void newEpisode(std::string recordingFilePath = "")` |
| :--    | :--                                                   |
| Python | `new_episode(recording_file_path: str = "") -> None`  |

Initializes a new episode. The state of an environment is completely restarted (all variables and rewards are reset to their initial values).
After calling this method, the first state from the new episode will be available.
If the `recordingFilePath` argument is not empty, the new episode will be recorded to this file (as a Doom lump).

In a multiplayer game, the host can call this method to finish the game.
Then the rest of the players must also call this method to start a new episode.

Note: Changed in 1.1.0

---
### `replayEpisode`

| C++    | `void replayEpisode(std::string filePath, unsigned int player = 0)` |
| :--    | :--                                                                 |
| Python | `replay_episode(file_path: str, player: int = 0) -> None`           |

Replays the recorded episode from the given file using the perspective of the specified player.
Players are numbered from 1, If `player` argument is equal to 0,
the episode will be replayed using the perspective of the default player in the recording file.
After calling this method, the first state from the replay will be available.
All rewards, variables, and states are available when replaying the episode.

Loads configuration (resolution, available buttons, game variables etc.) from a configuration file.
In case of multiple invocations, older configurations will be overwritten by the recent ones.
Overwriting does not involve resetting to default values. Thus only overlapping parameters will be changed.
The method returns true if the whole configuration file was correctly read and applied,
false if the file contained errors.

If the file relative path is given, it will be searched for in the following order: `<current directory>`, `<current directory>/scenarios/`, `<ViZDoom library location>/scenarios/`.
