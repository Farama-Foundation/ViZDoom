# Enums

ViZDoom is using few types of enums as parameters for its functions. Below you can find the description of all of them.
The declarations of all the enums can be found in the `include/ViZDoomTypes.h` header file.

## `Mode`

Enum type that defines all supported modes.

- **PLAYER** - synchronous player mode
- **SPECTATOR** - synchronous spectator mode
- **ASYNC_PLAYER** - asynchronous player mode
- **ASYNC_SPECTATOR** - asynchronous spectator mode

In **PLAYER** and **ASYNC_PLAYER** modes, the agent controls ingame character.

In **SPECTATOR** and **ASYNC_SPECTATOR** modes, ingame character should be controlled by the human and the agent gets information about the human action.

In **PLAYER** and **SPECTATOR** modes, the game waits for agent action or permission to continue.

In **ASYNC** modes the game progress with constant speed (default 35 tics per second, this can be set) without waiting for the agent actions.

All modes can be used in singleplayer and multiplayer.

- [`DoomGame: setTicrate`](./doomGame.md#setticrate).

## `ScreenFormat`

Enum type that defines all supported **screenBuffer** and **automapBuffer** formats.

- **CRCGCB**    - 3 channels of 8-bit values in RGB order
- **RGB24**     - channel of RGB values stored in 24 bits, where R value is stored in the oldest 8 bits
- **RGBA32**    - channel of RGBA values stored in 32 bits, where R value is stored in the oldest 8 bits
- **ARGB32**    - channel of ARGB values stored in 32 bits, where A value is stored in the oldest 8 bits
- **CBCGCR**    - 3 channels of 8-bit values in BGR order
- **BGR24**     - channel of BGR values stored in 24 bits, where B value is stored in the oldest 8 bits
- **BGRA32**    - channel of BGRA values stored in 32 bits, where B value is stored in the oldest 8 bits
- **ABGR32**    - channel of ABGR values stored in 32 bits, where A value is stored in the oldest 8 bits
- **GRAY8**     - 8-bit gray channel
- **DOOM_256_COLORS8** - 8-bit channel with Doom palette values


In **CRCGCB** and **CBCGCR** format **screenBuffer** and **automapBuffer** store all red 8-bit values then all green values and then all blue values, each channel is considered separately. As matrices they have [3, y, x] shape.

In **RGB24** and **BGR24** format **screenBuffer** and **automapBuffer** store 24 bit RGB triples. As matrices they have [y, x, 3] shape.

In **RGBA32**, **ARGB32**, **BGRA32** and **ABGR32** format **screenBuffer** and **automapBuffer** store 32 bit sets of RBG + alpha values. As matrices they have [y, x, 4] shape.

In **GRAY8** and **DOOM_256_COLORS8** format **screenBuffer** and **automapBuffer** store single 8 bit values. As matrices they have [y, x] shape.

**depthBuffer** and **lablesBuffer** always store single 8-bit values, so they always have [y, x] shape.

### Delta buttons

Buttons whose value defines the speed of movement.

In case of **TURN_LEFT_RIGHT_DELTA** and **LOOK_UP_DOWN_DELTA** values correspond to degrees.
In case of **MOVE_FORWARD_BACKWARD_DELTA**, **MOVE_LEFT_RIGHT_DELTA**, **MOVE_UP_DOWN_DELTA** values correspond to Doom Map unit (see Doom Wiki if you want to know how it translates into real life units).
