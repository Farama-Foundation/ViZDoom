# Python quick start

## Linux
To install the latest release of ViZDoom, just run:
```sh
pip install vizdoom
```
Both x86-64 and AArch64 (ARM64) architectures are supported.
Wheels are available for Python 3.8+ on Linux.

If Python wheel is not available for your platform (Python version <3.8, distros below manylinux_2_28 standard), pip will try to install (build) ViZDoom from the source.
ViZDoom requires a C++11 compiler, CMake 3.12+, Boost 1.54+ SDL2, OpenAL (optional), and Python 3.7+ to install from source. Below, you will find instructions on how to install these dependencies.

### apt-based distros (Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, etc.)

To build ViZDoom run (it may take a few minutes):
```sh
apt install cmake git libboost-all-dev libsdl2-dev libopenal-dev
pip install vizdoom
```
We recommend using at least Ubuntu 18.04+ or Debian 10+ with Python 3.7+.

### dnf/yum-based distros (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, Alma/Rocky Linux, etc.)

To install ViZDoom, run (it may take a few minutes):
```sh
dnf install cmake git boost-devel SDL2-devel openal-soft-devel
pip install vizdoom
```
We recommend using at least Fedora 35+ or RHEL/CentOS/Alma/Rocky Linux 9+ with Python 3.7+.
To install openal-soft-devel on RHEL/CentOS/Alma/Rocky Linux 9, one needs to use `dnf --enablerepo=crb install`.

### master branch version

To install the master branch version of ViZDoom run:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom
```


## macOS
To install the latest release of ViZDoom, just run (it may take a few minutes as it will build ViZDoom from source on M1/M2 chips):
```sh
brew install cmake boost sdl2 openal-soft
pip install vizdoom
```
Both Intel and Apple Silicon CPUs are supported.
We recommend using at least macOS High Sierra 10.13+ with Python 3.7+.
On Apple Silicon (M1 and M2), make sure you are using Python/Pip for Apple Silicon.

To install the master branch version of ViZDoom, run:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom
```


## Windows
To install the latest release of ViZDoom, just run:
```sh
pip install vizdoom
```
At the moment, only x86-64 architecture is supported on Windows.
Wheels are available for Python 3.8+ on Windows.

Please note that the Windows version is not as well-tested as Linux and macOS versions.
It can be used for development and testing but if you want to conduct serious (time and resource-extensive) experiments on Windows,
please consider using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) with Linux version.
