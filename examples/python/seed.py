# This script presents how to run deterministic episodes by setting
# seed. After setting the seed every episode will look the same (if
# agent will behave deterministicly of course).
# Configuration is loaded from "../../examples/config/<SCENARIO_NAME>.cfg" file.
# <episodes> number of episodes are played.
# Random combination of buttons is chosen for every action.
#
# Game variables from state and last reward are printed.
#
# To see the scenario description go to "../../scenarios/README.md"
