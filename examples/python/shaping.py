# This script presents how to make use of game variables to implement
# shaping using health_guided.wad scenario
# Health_guided scenario is just like health_gathering
# (see "../../scenarios/README.md") but for each collected medkit global
# variable number 1 in acs script (corresponding to USER1) is increased
# by 100.0. It is not considered a part of reward but will possibly
# reduce learning time.
# <episodes> number of episodes are played.
# Random combination of buttons is chosen for every action.
# Game variables from state and last reward are printed.
