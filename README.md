# ViZDoom [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/vizdoom.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/vizdoom) ![Build](https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

ViZDoom allows developing AI **bots that play Doom using only the visual information** (the screen buffer). It is primarily intended for research in machine visual learning, and deep reinforcement learning, in particular.

ViZDoom is based on [ZDoom](https://github.com/rheit/zdoom) to provide the game mechanics.

## Features
- Multi-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows),
- API for Python, C++, and Julia (thanks to [Jun Tian](https://github.com/findmyway)), and also Lua and Java for older versions,
- [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environment wrappers for basic scenarios.
- Easy-to-create custom scenarios (visual editors, scripting language and examples available),
- Async and sync single-player and multi-player modes,
- Fast (up to 7000 fps in sync mode, single-threaded),
- Lightweight (few MBs),
- Customizable resolution and rendering parameters,
- Access to the depth buffer (3D vision),
- Automatic labelling game objects visible in the frame,
- Access to the audio buffer (thanks to [Shashank Hegde](https://github.com/hegde95)),
- Access to the list of actors/objects and map geometry,
- Off-screen rendering,
- Episodes recording,
- Time scaling in async mode.

ViZDoom API is **reinforcement learning** friendly (suitable also for learning from demonstration, apprenticeship learning or apprenticeship via inverse reinforcement learning, etc.).

## Python quick start

### Ubuntu
To install ViZDoom on Ubuntu run (may take few minutes):
```
sudo apt install cmake libboost-all-dev libsdl2-dev libfreetype6-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libbz2-dev libfluidsynth-dev libgme-dev libopenal-dev zlib1g-dev timidity tar nasm
pip install vizdoom
```
We recommend using at least Ubuntu 18.04+ with Python 3.6+.

### Conda
To install ViZDoom on a conda environment (no system-wide installations required):
```
conda install -c conda-forge boost cmake gtk2 sdl2
git clone https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom.git
cd ViZDoom
python setup.py build && python setup.py install
```
Note that `pip install vizdoom` won't work with conda install and you have to follow these steps.

### macOS 
To install ViZDoom on macOS run (may take few minutes):
```
brew install cmake boost openal-soft sdl2
pip install vizdoom
```
We recommend using at least macOS High Sierra 10.13+ with Python 3.6+.
Currently, only for Intel CPU, we will gladly accept PR with M1 support.

### Windows
To install pre-build release for Windows 10 or 11 64-bit and Python 3.6+ just run (should take few seconds):
```
pip install vizdoom
```

### Gym wrappers
If you wish to use OpenAI Gym environments, install ViZDoom with
```
pip install vizdoom[gym]
```
See [documentation](doc/Gym.md) and [examples](examples/python/gym_wrapper.py) on the use of Gym API.


## Examples

- [Python](examples/python) (contain learning examples implemented in PyTorch, TensorFlow and Theano)
- [C++](examples/c%2B%2B)
- [Julia](examples/julia)

Python examples are currently the richest, so we recommend to look at them, even if you plan to use other language. API is almost identical for all languages.

**See also the [tutorial](http://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/tutorial).**


## Original Doom graphics

If you own original Doom or Doom 2 games, you can replace [Freedoom](https://freedoom.github.io/) graphics by placing `doom.wad` or `doom2.wad` into your working directory or `vizdoom` package directory.

Alternatively, any base game WAD (including other Doom engine-based games) can be used by pointing to it with the [`set_doom_game_path/setDoomGamePath`](https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom/blob/master/doc/DoomGame.md#-setdoomscenariopath) method.
