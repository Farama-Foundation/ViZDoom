ViZDoom allows developing AI **bots that play Doom using only visual information** (the screen buffer). It is primarily intended for research in machine visual learning, and deep reinforcement learning, in particular.

ViZDoom is based on [ZDoom](https://github.com/rheit/zdoom) to provide the game mechanics.

## Features
- Multi-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows),
- API for Python and C++,
- [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)/[OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) environment wrappers (thanks to [Arjun KG](https://github.com/arjun-kg) [Benjamin Noah Beal](https://github.com/bebeal), [Lawrence Francis](https://github.com/ldfrancis), and [Mark Towers](https://github.com/pseudo-rnd-thoughts)),
- Easy-to-create custom scenarios (visual editors, scripting language, and examples available),
- Async and sync single-player and multiplayer modes,
- Fast (up to 7000 fps in sync mode, single-threaded),
- Lightweight (few MBs),
- Customizable resolution and rendering parameters,
- Access to the depth buffer (3D vision),
- Automatic labeling of game objects visible in the frame,
- Access to the audio buffer (thanks to [Shashank Hegde](https://github.com/hegde95)),
- Access to the list of actors/objects and map geometry,
- Off-screen rendering,
- Episodes recording,
- In-game time scaling in async mode.

ViZDoom API is **reinforcement learning** friendly (suitable also for learning from demonstration, apprenticeship learning or apprenticeship via inverse reinforcement learning, etc.).

Julia (thanks to [Jun Tian](https://github.com/findmyway)), Lua, and Java bindings are available in other branches but are no longer maintained.

## Python quick start

### Linux
To install the latest release of ViZDoom, just run:
```sh
pip install vizdoom
```
Both x86-64 and AArch64 (ARM64) architectures are supported.
Wheels are available for Python 3.8+ on Linux.

If Python wheel is not available for your platform (Python version <3.8, distros below manylinux_2_28 standard), pip will try to install (build) ViZDoom from the source.
ViZDoom requires a C++11 compiler, CMake 3.12+, Boost 1.54+ SDL2, OpenAL (optional), and Python 3.7+ to install from source. See [documentation](https://vizdoom.farama.org/introduction/pythonQuickstart/) for more details.


### macOS
To install the latest release of ViZDoom, just run (it may take a few minutes as it will build ViZDoom from source on M1/M2 chips):
```sh
brew install cmake boost sdl2 openal-soft
pip install vizdoom
```
Both Intel and Apple Silicon CPUs are supported.
We recommend using at least macOS High Sierra 10.13+ with Python 3.7+.
On Apple Silicon (M1 and M2), make sure you are using Python/Pip for Apple Silicon.


### Windows
To install the latest release of ViZDoom, just run:
```sh
pip install vizdoom
```
At the moment, only x86-64 architecture is supported on Windows.
Wheels are available for Python 3.8+ on Windows.

Please note that the Windows version is not as well-tested as Linux and macOS versions.
It can be used for development and testing but if you want to conduct serious (time and resource-extensive) experiments on Windows,
please consider using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) with Linux version.


### Gymnasium/Gym wrappers
Gymnasium environments are installed along with ViZDoom.
See [documentation](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/blob/master/doc/Gymnasium.md) and [examples](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/blob/master/examples/python/gymnasium_wrapper.py) on the use of Gymnasium API.

OpenAI-Gym wrappers are also available, to install them run:
```
pip install vizdoom[gym]
```
See [documentation](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/blob/master/doc/Gym.md) and [examples](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/blob/master/examples/python/gym_wrapper.py) on the use of Gym API.
**OpenAI-Gym wrappers are deprecated and will be removed in future versions in favour of Gymnasium.**


## Examples
- [Python](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/blob/master/examples/python) (contain learning examples implemented in PyTorch, TensorFlow and Theano)
- [C++](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/blob/master/examples/c%2B%2B)

Python examples are currently the richest, so we recommend to look at them, even if you plan to use other language. The API is almost identical for all languages.

**See also the [tutorial](http://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/tutorial).**


## Original Doom graphics
Unfortunately, we cannot distribute ViZDoom with original Doom graphics.
If you own original Doom or Doom 2 games, you can replace [Freedoom](https://freedoom.github.io/) graphics by placing `doom.wad` or `doom2.wad` into your working directory or `vizdoom` package directory.

Alternatively, any base game WAD (including other Doom engine-based games and custom/community games) can be used by pointing to it with the [`set_doom_game_path/setDoomGamePath`](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/blob/master/doc/DoomGame.md#-setdoomscenariopath) method.


## Documentation
Detailed descriptions of all ViZDoom types and methods can be found in the [documentation](https://vizdoom.farama.org/).

Full documentation of the ZDoom engine and ACS scripting language can be found on
[ZDoom Wiki](https://zdoom.org/wiki/).

Useful articles (for advanced users who want to create custom environments/scenarios):
- [ZDoom Wiki: ACS (scripting language)](https://zdoom.org/wiki/ACS)
- [ZDoom Wiki: CVARs (console variables)](https://zdoom.org/wiki/CVARs)
- [ZDoom Wiki: CCMD (console commands)](https://zdoom.org/wiki/CCMDs)

## Contributions
This project is maintained and developed in our free time. All bug fixes, new examples, scenarios, and other contributions are welcome! We are also open to feature ideas and design suggestions.

We have a roadmap for future development work for ViZDoom available [here](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/ViZDoom/issues/546).
